**TreeScan™** is a data mining software that allows users to analyze large data sets using a different version of the tree-based scan statistic. It looks for excess risk in any of a large number of individual cells in a database as well as in groups of closely related cells. It can be used to detect side effects of drugs and vaccines, as well as to find a significant signal in other data in hierarchical tree structures.

**rtreescan** allows TreeScan™ to operate in an R environment, making it convenient and flexible. The functions in the package can be grouped into three main parts: parameter functions that set parameters for TreeScan™ or write them in a file to the OS; execution functions that run TreeScan™ in OS and generate output files; plotting functions that visualizes the structure of a tree.

**rtreescan** only does anything useful if you have TreeScan™. It is not open-source, but it is distributed free of charge. You can be downloaded for free from the link. <https://www.treescan.org>
